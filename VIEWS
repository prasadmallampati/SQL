											## VIEWS ##
1. what is view ?
In MySQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result set of an SQL query. 
Views are used to simplify complex queries, encapsulate logic,
and enhance security by restricting access to specific rows or columns.

2.Why do we use views ?
Security: Views can be used to grant users access to specific data while hiding other details.
Performance: Views can sometimes impact performance, especially if the underlying query is complex.
Updatability: Not all views are updatable. Views involving joins, aggregations, or groupings might not support data updates.
